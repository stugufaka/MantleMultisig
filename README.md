# What it does

NFTs have been around for a while now, but their popularity has exploded in recent months. So what exactly are NFTs? And why are they so popular?

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that are unique and cannot be replicated. This makes them perfect for things like collectibles, art, and other digital items that have value because they are rare.

One of the reasons NFTs have become so popular is because they provide a way for artists and creators to monetize their work in a way that wasn't possible before. For example, an artist can create a digital painting and then sell it as an NFT. The buyer can then display the painting in their digital gallery or even resell it for a profit.

Another reason NFTs are gaining in popularity is because they're a way to invest in the future of the digital world. As more and more of our lives move online, it's likely that NFTs will become an important part of the digital economy. So by buying NFTs now, you're investing in the future of the digital world.

If you're interested in buying NFTs, one of the best places to do so is Universo. Universo is an online NFT platform that restores the original and classic NFTs. With a simple interface, you can upload an NFT and start selling it directly on the market.

# Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/)
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

# Getting started

The project consist of the backend and also the front end.

### Prerequisites

- nodejs installed
- npm
- Hardhat

```
npm install npm@latest -g
npm install -g hardhat
```

### Local setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

1. Clone the project locally, change into the directory, and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/mendsalbert/nftproject

cd nftproject

# install using NPM or Yarn
npm install

# or

yarn
```

2. Start the local Hardhat node

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

3. With the network running, deploy the contracts to the local network in a separate terminal window

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

4. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

### Configuration

The chain ID should be 80001. If you have a localhost rpc set up, you may need to overwrite it.

To deploy to Polygon test or main networks, update the configurations located in **hardhat.config.js** to use a private key and, optionally, deploy to a private RPC like Infura.

```javascript
/* hardhat.config.js */
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle");
require("hardhat-contract-sizer");
const privateKey = "private key here";

const projectId = "xxx";

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337,
      allowUnlimitedContractSize: true,
    },

    matic: {
      url: "---matic url here---",
      accounts: [privateKey],
    },
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.9",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 1,
      },
    },
  },
};
```
